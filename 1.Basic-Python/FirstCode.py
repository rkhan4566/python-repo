"""
Real-World Example: Multithreading for I/O-bound Tasks
Scenario: Web Scraping
Web scraping often involves making numerous network requests to
fetch web pages. These tasks are I/O-bound because they spend a lot of
time waiting for responses from servers. Multithreading can significantly
improve the performance by allowing multiple web pages to be fetched concurrently.
